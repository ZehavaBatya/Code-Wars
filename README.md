# Code-Wars 
Code Wars is a training platform that tracks and challenges my programming journey through ranks, or kata.The more challenges that are completed, the higher the rank one achieves in a gamified manner. There are several languages trainees can choose to train in, such as Ruby, C#, and Swift. Check out the langauges I tackle and let's fight a war that is not in our hands, but in our minds. Other components include being ranked against other players and seeing what others put for their solutions as a solid learning community.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** The "tech used" section does not exactly apply here, but I have started with JavaScript 8kyu. 

In the JavaScript 8kyu, I am given tasks that are challenging, yet exciting, such as the following: converting boolean values to stirngs, removing elements, calculating summation, conveting DNA to RNA, reversed sequences, and many more.  

## Optimizations

I believe I am striving for greatness through my adventerous nature of tackling the unknown. No matter where we are, the people Future updates include incorporating other languages to wrestle with and to tackle the exercises with mastery. It is significant for me to learn the theory of the "why" behind why the solution is the solution. As always, I attempt to make my own versions of the solution and problem by reverse engineering the prompts at hand. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learning to learn is seriously stretching my brain to new levels and new heights. Code Wars never fails to make the brain sweat... Thankfully I am learning how to swim by giving me the opportunity to apply my solutions to real-world sitations. I learned more about using syntax, about how to speak more fluenty in the given language, as well as fundamentally challenging my thought process from being right-brained and transitioning it into becomong more left-brained.
